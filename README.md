## 🚀 **Get Up and Running (It's Easier Than You Think!)**

Ready to start predicting? Follow these simple steps:

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. If not, grab it!

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url_here>
    cd stock-market-predictor
    ```
    *(**Heads Up!** If you haven't uploaded this to GitHub yet, you can skip `git clone` and just ensure all project files are in one directory.)*

2.  **Install the essential libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit tensorflow yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

3.  **Model Magic: Train or Place Your Model!**
    Our `app.py` needs a brain: `Stock Predictions Model.keras`. You have two options:
    * **Train it yourself:** Open and run the `Stock_Market_Prediction_Model_Creation.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. It walks you through building and saving the model.
    * **Place a pre-trained model:** If you already have `Stock Predictions Model.keras`, just put it in the same directory as `app.py`.

    **🚨 IMPORTANT PATH FIX! 🚨**
    The current `app.py` has a specific path for the model: `'C:\\Python\\Stock\\Stock Predictions Model.keras'`.
    **For hassle-free use, we highly recommend changing this line in `app.py` to:**
    ```python
    model = load_model('Stock Predictions Model.keras')
    ```
    This way, the model can be located in the same folder as your `app.py` script.

### **Launching the App (Prepare for Lift-Off! 🚀)**

Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
